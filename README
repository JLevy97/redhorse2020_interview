some elements of part one are still broken. I ran out of time and it was my first time creating a web-page. 

To run programs. 

Parts 1/2 can be run by installing python's flask. from there, traverse to the directory where Part1.py or csvSaver.py is located.

Run: 	set (or export if on linux) FLASK_APP = Part1.py (or csvSaver.py)
	flask run

This will launch the server.
For Part1, click on the in the terminal to take you to the site. 
For part 2, any REST (POST) requests sent to this IP/processjson will launch the micro-service that saves that requests data as a csv

Part 3 can be compiled and run as a java program from the source folder.
